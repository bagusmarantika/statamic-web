    content_item: |
      <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html" target="_blank">Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus</a>.

    title_item: 'How does the virus spread?'
    content_item: |
      <p>This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.
      </p>
      <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html" target="_blank">some affected geographic areas</a>. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

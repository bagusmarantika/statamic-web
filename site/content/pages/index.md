    summary_article: |
      <article>
      <p>A person can become infected from someone with COVID-19. This disease can spread through small droplets from the nose or mouth when coughing or sneezing. The droplet then falls on the object around it. Then if someone else touches an object that has been contaminated with the droplets, then that person touches the eyes, nose or mouth (triangle face), then that person can be infected with COVID-19. A person can also become infected with COVID-19 when accidentally inhaling droplets from sufferers. This is why it is important to keep a distance of up to one meter or so from people who are sick.

title: 'What is the source of the virus?'
content_news: |
  <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html" target="_blank">Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus</a>.
